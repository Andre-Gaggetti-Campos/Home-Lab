# Home-Lab

Here I document my progression towards and the use of my personal Home Lab.

## So, what am I trying to do?

Home Labs are kind of expensive... Due to recent developments in demand for RAM and other important factors to a Lab's efficiency, prices to enter this hobby have been shooting up in the past year.

So I decided I should just start learning and start looking for deals in the meanwhile: praise FaceBook marketplace. I'll initially be doing labs in a purely virtualized environment (currently a swarm of VirtualBox VMs).

I have a vision of what my first physical setup will look like. Small, self contained, and, most importantly, not rack based. I intend to design a small form factor of a typically 10" rack setup that has modularity in mind.

However, due to my completely self-imposed restrictions above, I'll likely have to design and create it myself. Time to learn modeling.
